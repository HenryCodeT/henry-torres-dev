# **Overview**

This project delivers a modern, animated, Peru-inspired developer portfolio designed to showcase the developer’s professional experience (≈4 years), technical capabilities, and projects. It uniquely blends immersive motion design with an interactive **Llama Guide** and a fully client-facing **static RAG-powered AI assistant (Llamita AI)**.

Unlike traditional architectures, this portfolio operates **entirely within Next.js**, with no external backend services. All retrieval data and embeddings are stored as static files (e.g., `/public/embeddings.json`). A lightweight RAG pipeline is executed through Next.js API Routes, which provide secure LLM access while keeping the site serverless and simple.

The portfolio targets:

* **Recruiters**, who need quick, accurate, verified insights.
* **Engineering managers / tech leads**, who expect structured, technically rich answers.
* **Potential clients**, seeking clarity on services and prior work.

The product is valuable because it provides:

* A memorable, animated personal brand
* Truth-aligned AI responses grounded in static embeddings
* A maintainable, scalable codebase without backend complexity
* A delightful storytelling experience blending Cusco aesthetics with modern UI

---

## **UX / UI Considerations**

* Animations must remain lightweight and performant
* Lazy-load Lottie assets when possible
* The chat widget must be mobile-friendly
* Maintain cohesion with the Cusco/Peru-inspired color palette
* Offer reduced-motion mode for accessibility
* Avoid overwhelming low-power devices

---

# **Technical Architecture**

## **System Components**

* **Frontend:**

  * Next.js (App Router)
  * React
  * TailwindCSS
  * Framer Motion
  * Lottie + GSAP

* **Static RAG:**

# **Risks & Mitigations**

| Risk                                              | Mitigation                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Large embeddings file impacts load time           | Chunk efficiently; compress; load on demand                          |
| API key exposure                                  | Always use API Routes; no client-side LLM calls                      |
| RAG accuracy depends on quality of chunks         | Use controlled chunking and strict grounding prompts                 |
| Animation-heavy pages may cause performance drops | Lazy-load animations; reduce Lottie size; GPU-accelerated transforms |
| Static RAG cannot update dynamically              | Include embedding-generation script in repo for easy refresh         |
